  features: [
    "Automatic flood segmentation from uploaded images to generate clear and readable flood masks.",
    "Two models in one system: U-Net and U-Net++ to compare segmentation performance on the same case.",
    "Analysis statistics: flood area (%), flood pixel count, total pixels, and model difference summary.",
    "Compare mode: displays Original vs U-Net Mask vs U-Net++ Mask and disagreement map for areas of conflict.",
    "Model agreement score to measure prediction consistency between U-Net and U-Net++ (consensus & pixel difference).",
    "Python backend inference pipeline deployed to Microsoft Azure for online access and scalability.",
    "Quick workflow: upload image > inference > result visualization > download/recap analysis.",
  ],
  impact: [
    "Enables rapid identification of flood-affected areas from imagery, making situational analysis more efficient.",
    "Provides quantitative estimates (area/pixel count) that can serve as a basis for reporting and condition monitoring.",
    "Facilitates segmentation model evaluation through direct U-Net vs U-Net++ comparison to select the best approach.",
