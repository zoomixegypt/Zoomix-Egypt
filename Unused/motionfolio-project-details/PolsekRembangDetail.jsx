    "Consistent answer format (plain text): no markdown, no unusual symbols - easily readable on any device.",
    "Quick actions to speed up user flow: e.g., police service buttons, incident reports, and contact an officer.",
    "Download transcript: users can download chat history as evidence/conversation summary.",
    "Multimodal mode (optional): can receive images for analysis if needed (e.g., evidence or simple visual context).",

  impact: [
    "Speeds up access to service information: citizens no longer need to search for procedures and requirements as answers are instantly available via chat.",
    "Reduces repetitive questions to officers for administrative matters (SKCK, lost items, permits), allowing officers to focus on field services.",
    "Enhances citizen experience with clear, consistent, and human-like responses - bringing public services closer through AI technology.",
