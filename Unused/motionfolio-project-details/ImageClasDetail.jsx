  tagline:
    "A TensorFlow-based image classification app that recognizes various vegetable types from uploaded photos, complete with confidence scores and Top-5 predictions in an interactive UI.",
  year: "2025",
  stack: ["TensorFlow / Keras", "Python", "Streamlit"],
  features: [
    "Simple image upload: supports drag & drop or file browse (JPG/JPEG/PNG) for instant classification.",
    "Primary prediction + confidence score: displays classification results that are easy for users to understand.",
    "Top-5 predictions: provides alternative predictions with score rankings for increased model transparency.",
    "Confidence visualization: confidence level bars to clarify how certain the model is about its predictions.",
    "Recognized class catalog: displays the list of vegetables the model can predict so users know the model's scope.",
    "Responsive and clean UI: focused on user experience to make the ML demo feel like a real product.",
  ],
  impact: [
    "Makes vegetable type identification from photos quick and easy - ideal for computer vision demos and AI education.",
    "Builds user trust as prediction results are displayed transparently through confidence scores and Top-5 rankings.",
    "Represents a complete end-to-end pipeline: from TensorFlow model training to deployment/inference in a web application.",
